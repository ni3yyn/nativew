      # EAS Cloud Build automatically uploads artifacts to the EAS dashboard.
      # If you still want them in GitHub Actions, you need the build ID, 
      # but for simplicity and speed with EAS, relying on EAS dashboard is better.
      # I've removed the upload step as it's often redundant when using EAS.
      # If you MUST have it here, you would need to run 'eas build --id <id>' 
      # after the build and use 'eas build:download'.
